"""AllMoviesModel, strict to a type checker, all-optional at runtime.

A type checker reads the strict model, so every field carries the type and
the requiredness the schema recorded. At runtime the all-optional copy is imported
instead, so a response that has drifted still parses and a field the data is
missing is None despite what its type hint says.
