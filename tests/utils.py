Nothing here knows about a particular endpoint. What an endpoint's own test file
brings is the ids it downloads, the model it parses into and what it expects to
find; recording a response and reading it back is the same either way.

A recording is filed under the name of the model that reads it, which is what
lets `generate_models.py` build each model from everything recorded for it.
